# What I've learned from the Basics of GitHub course.

## Markdown File
- By reading throught the Basic writring and formatting and syntax page I am somewhat more familiar with markdown files.
- One example of syntax are the different amounts of pound symbols used to distinguish different heading levels.
- I am also becomming familiar with syntax that I can use to style my text such as **the double asterix** which makes text **bold**.
- In this case I am using the dash symbol to create bullet points but there are other ways to create lists in markfown files such as numbers. 

## Git vs GitHub
- I understand the use case of GitHub as being the online version of Git which is a tool which allows people to collaborate in coding projects.
- I would like to better understand how Git functitons behind the scenes to fully explore its limitations.

## Repositories
- As I understand it, _repositories_ are what contains projects.
- Repositories contains a lot of terminology and features that I do not yet fully understand but I will become more aquainted with practice.
- Features such as **Branches**, **Forks**, **Pull Requests** and **Issues** are breifly described but I would like to apply these tools in projects.

## Overall
- The course provided me with a basic introduction to Git and GitHub but my understanding is only theoretical and not applicable.
- I will continue to familirase myself with both Git and GitHub to hopfully become fluent in both.
